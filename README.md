SilSys Development Kit or SSDK is a Live Linux Distribution that is based on Debian 12 (Bookworm). It includes development kit, weird compilers and interpreters and other interesting programs. This can be run using bare-metal (your actual laptop/PC) and Virtualization.

It contains open source Software Development Kits (SDK) intended for creating homebrew softwares for any of the PlayStation, Sega and Nintendo systems, and hackbrews to tinker game roms. This allows you to create applications, games, and more (homebrew) to run on consoles.
