# SilSys Development Kit Live ISO
This is a proof of concept of building a Linux Distribution targeted for developing games, homebrew software and debugging
in a wide range of paltform, especially the vintage or decade old Video Game Consoles. SSDK, or SilSys Development Kit is a 
live distribution that includes development kit, weird compilers and interpreters and other interesting programs. This can 
be run using bare-metal (your actual laptop/PC) and Virtualization.

This distribution includes open source Software Development Kits (SDK) intended for creating homebrew softwares for any of 
the PlayStation, Sega and Nintendo systems. This allows you to create applications, games, and more (homebrew) to run on 
consoles. These SDKs does not mean to work perfectly without any issues, so the user needs to know not only the basics of 
Linux troubleshooting but have a background with programming language, mostly C based.

But unfortunately, even if there are toolchains for each platform, there are missing libraries and third party software 
dependencies on some of the platform because the development is immature, issues on building it, or sometimes there is no 
open source library exist, so developing games is impossible unless you provide them. Some of the platform have complete set 
of development kit to create full functional games, notably for the NES, GBA and others. And because most of the software 
for development, patchers, editors, utilities, graphics, etc. are released only for Windows systems, installing free and open 
source alternative softwares can be painful to us as it requires you to build that software from source, configure itâ€™s 
variables and compile them.

You can download packed file containing ISO and documentation, or just documentation here:

# Mount squashfs
You can mount squashfs of this distribution on your existing Linux distribution you are using instead of running this in 
virtual machine or on your actual PC.
